This is a first attempt at a personal website. It will be an HTML/CSS heavy project, with JS used to add functionality.

Iterations:
- Navbar (sidebar in this example)
- Hero Image
- Link to Github
- Link to LinkedIn
- Link to About Me
- Fun About Me Section
- Contact Me

Heavily influenced by: http://seanhalpin.io/
